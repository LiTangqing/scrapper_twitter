# scrapper_twitter
scrappers in Python wrote by myself to get tweets for various purposes.

## 1. get_tweets.ipynb
This scrapper allows to scrape the tweets from a list of predefined users. 
The example in the notebook shows a list of users from the financial industry.

The tweets will be aranged in a pandas dataframe format. 
Minimum sentiment analysis is done at the end. 

### How to use get_tweets.ipynb?
You will need to apply for a developer account from twitter and get your API credentials. After getting the account, 
replace the correpsonding lines with your information, and you are all set. 

Happy coding.
